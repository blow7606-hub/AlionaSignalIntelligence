# Aliona Field Coupling Studio (Rebuild)

Streamlit app for coupling / coherence diagnostics (CGC + dCGC + conditional controls) on **two uploaded datasets**, plus a Sandbox Generator for known-truth validation.

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deploy (free)
Use Streamlit Community Cloud by connecting this repo on GitHub.

## What to upload (easy mode)
- Use the **Sandbox** tab to generate `sandbox_A.csv` and `sandbox_B.csv`, then upload those on the **Coupling Test** tab.
